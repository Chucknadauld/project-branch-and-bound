- [ ] Comparison of Theoretical and Empirical Results of Branch and Bound TSP
- [ ] Provide plot comparing theoretical time complexity to observed runtimes
- [ ] If theoretical and empirical results match
  - [ ] Simply state this
  - [ ] If they do not match
- [ ] Provide a plot showing a theoretical time complexity that more closely follows the observed runtimes

- [ ] Provide a brief summary of your conversation
- [ ] Include the reasoning. (ExTrans: details in your .txt/LaTeX/docs
- [ ] Create a plot demonstrating the amount of search space explored over time
- [ ] Include the statistics of one of your Backtracking Algorithms from Project Backtracking on your plot
- [ ] Discuss the differences observed between the amount of search space explored between the backtracking algorithm versus Branch and Bound. In your opinion, does the B&B algorithm make a meaningful difference to the results?
- [ ] Implement Smart Branch and Bound
- [ ] Pass the Stretch 2 tests
- [ ] You may modify the contents of 'FRAME_FOR_SMART_BRANCH_AND_BOUND_SMART_TEST' in tsp_solver.py to demonstrate how your smart branch and bound performs better than your regular branch and bound
- [ ] Comment on what key you selected for your priority queue and why you selected it
- [ ] Run your smart B&B algorithm and your regular B&B algorithm (core test) on 20 different random seeds and report on how much better the smart B&B algorithm performs. Include a table and a plot summarizing this data.
