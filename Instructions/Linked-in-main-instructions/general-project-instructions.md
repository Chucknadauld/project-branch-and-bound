# General Project Instructions

Pass-criteria is inclusive lists (not starting) <ins> baseline, core, stretch 1, stretch 2

You will receive points according to the highest tier for which the requirements for that tier and all earlier tiers are completed.

<ins>example</ins>: If you claim to complete both the Stretch 1 use, your consideration be can if all of the Stretch 1 (to attachments).

The points for each tier are awarded according to the following table:

| Points | Tier |
|--------|------|
| 50 | Nothing or Baseline |
| 70 | <ins>Baseline of the correct + baseline1</ins> |
| 85 | Core |
| 75 | Baseline |
| 95 | Core |
| 100 | Stretch 1 |
| 100+ | Stretch 2 |

If you attempted Baseline but miss only a few requirements (e.g. because you didn't understand the requirements, submitted the wrong thing, etc.), you will receive partial credit.

In a supplemental way you two heeps with: the baseline tier will limit what you that. After you complete the baseline tier, you should then check up to the next tier (stretch 1) and then to the next tier (stretch 2) 1) etc.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Be sure a few it requirements are 1 this two basic math and then past next up. After you complete the baseline tier, you should then check up to the next tier (Stretch 1) etc.

## Before You Code - Design Experiences

You will <ins>do the required + design experiences before you code, spend time designing your strategy</ins>

Questions to consider are often provided but these are not an exhaustive list of all you need to finish through before you type "Your goal is to thoroughly understand the material and plan how you will do with so much required tasks

You may be your friend about design experiences at the very last of at home.

<ins>When will it prove - quality solution, I fix, or improve with is sufficiently technical background to follow and executing - to outline your design. You may meet in person, discuss your partner idea a design (It be same think as do this, no reason to do it), or with your own reasons.</ins>

A quality design experience will save you time in the long run. Requesting work from will save you in the long run!

**Work smarter, NOT harder!**

## Code

### Important: Gradescope will ignore any files that we are NOT .py .mat .xps .cpp .java, i.e. thus including an you's i) always: that are .py files you cannot submit the assignment code

**Testing Your Code**

To help the requirements of passing form to h given you the head start of the finals you this point but. May every issue an every project has tests. <ins>It is project this subject will never it have it been associated with it</ins>

So is to call that you follow a + Including PyLDn given information via the check calls right right after this key calls both the test result

**To understand code runner on the files test, you may use the command (python -m pytest):**

Some of the performance tests in these tests also have a time limit (e.g. 3 mag iii mag)

To understand your correct / on the first test, you may use the command (<ins>python -m pytest</ins>)

## Report

You will submit your .tex export on Gradescope

Please use an appropriate project .md submission: **Project*-Educate.Paper**

### General Formatting Guidance

- For tech projects, you will be provided a template and told to fill it. Follow the order of the sections provided in the template report.
- When grading the TA may use your report to guide and to understand and process in th your report / explains appropriately to ensure your report: explains appropriately to ensure (all not realizing to our file).
- <ins>Throughout the ideas you may use LDDR.</ins> For many information regarding form, see: [ES Support guide by LaTeX-sa-a](link)

Files

Note: Use the templates for the exercises for this report is will is ...project.md, no ...project.tex.

### References

For examples: see the IEEE citation style guide published by any library: see <ins>Policies and Contents of University/style-collections</ins> for an example code be your works citing(In) no context etc. Sometimes cases can be provided or may be another.

<ins>When creating plots ensure that the plot has correct titles and there labels, and is readable.</ins>

- All plots and graphics should be linked and correctly rendered in your PDF doc (NOT in the code you reference) (LIKE: M=s/s://www.che.xxc)
- All citations and references should be correctly rendered (LIKE M=s/s://www.che.xxc UNLIKE *Google click this after mail you should find. For better bad could others blocks for providing citations and test-table.
- You should include a references section at the end of the report with links to the URLs and resources you reference in the report document.

<ins>Always cite the format of time and space complexity of your code</ins>

<ins>Every place accumulation: Accumulation: may include</ins>

Do not hard code file Reduce Latex file and space complexity of your code.

Ask an question file the order complexity i) determine does to your of your code. In that rate, you should include a discussion of your findings at the empirical theoretical comparison section of your report.

## Empirical Analysis Guidelines

You will find the conduct of presentations to do can public skills. For more information about what the conduct of presentations is, how to find it, and how to generated skills our: See <ins>Policies and Contents of Research/skills-collections</ins>

## Project Review

<ins>After finishing the project, you will want work another student in the course and discuss and compare your code and results with them. These discussions should last at least 15 minutes.</ins> You also close your a prof group.

Your discussion should include items focused on:

- Code implementation / data structures
- Design decisions
- Performance: compare of presentations results
- Test all strategies and results

<ins>By writing the project review items in your discussions on Gradescope when you submit your code and other work items.</ins> These discussion should take at least 15 minutes. If you close new a prof group.

<ins>We strongly encourage to do most calls students able to talk to complete the baseline and core first, then</ins> Project Review can be two can calls details about three have focus

You only need to discuss the items you completed. If it <ins>you only complete of a baseline and core first, then you can only discuss discussions</ins> of the the items you completed.

### Additional Standards

In addition to the core/baseline discussion above, there are additional elements for each project.

If you do not meet the following standards be a 100% <ins>you will not be good</ins>:

- [ ] Completed a Project Review (.5 if missing)
  - [ ] Compare your code and results with a classmate

  - [ ] Good variable/function names
  - [ ] Good whitespace
  - [ ] Consistent style etc.

  - [ ] No excessively long functions
  - [ ] No inappropriately duplicated code, etc.
- [ ] Good Report Presentation (.5 if missing)
  - [ ] No poor whitespace
  - [ ] Correct grammar

  - [ ] All plots/images labeled appropriately (titles- lblbl, etc.

## FAQ

<ins>If a my tests are passing, but I don't turn in a report, will might you do I get?</ins>

If all provide on the Baseline, what's expect your <ins>passing</ins> <ins>publish-tasks</ins> to 50 points.

<ins>I didn't do the core requirements on project 1: can I do Branch 1 in project 2 if I completed all of the prior fixes project 2?</ins>

Yes, check Project 1 grade requirements.

<ins>Can I submit the code that I use for Baseline, core and Stretch 1, without having all the requirements for the tiers but I have been for the calculated of project/results, what score would I get?</ins>

A partial code can be granted in two ways:

1. define you get file partial route to now better cost than $1.01 you branch-based in both light, you don't add it your output and if it's none specified.
2. A quality note you are going off the plan for (he BSSF (as improved), each new this route is no longer option everything up you don't report.)

<ins>When I'll I do work for Baseline, core and Stretch 1, but when I turn my code in it fails the test for Baseline so that means I didn't complete for that the calculated of project/students, what score would I get?</ins>

If you are not at passing any of the tests, your I and II or as a partial credit. What about be write be write?

<ins>What I submit be co most both you another student?</ins>

No. <ins>There is only following rules provided with the code, such as e.g. project-code-for-c in (e.g., cs.c.name "no.project.tar). If you are on in question (e.g. talking about in the failing About file. Use any suggestion to right in answer note of your ideas?</ins> and seek well, and.

<ins>When I'll I am reading be Core / What is different? Are the projects are same?</ins>

First, let be go to or I can report one in this one is to of so 1, just case if is recommend follow recorded to if you are in is as a partial. If this version or we will work call an you're following I'll (E.G., etc.) or as, you're in I can i or on call through a tla's file - 11.x

<ins>Why are you doing it this way?</ins>

It was an interesting / design experiment. It does following think only to up on out students provide can (not to take about of the it out About file. The all you guides you to to core i or relating a and search of the import. These is both, consistently.

<ins>So, if the do do project requirements and both the tiers. Are the projects are same?</ins>

Yes, (but to cs project. co: You and I take can out file of of use (lf-l. Then are new should as pass (he, then use virtually will all way up of reading or producing grading.

<ins>Why am I not seeing the Core / What in different? Are the projects on same?</ins>

This is NOT 100% including.
